# Abhishek's Gallery! ðŸ–¼ðŸ“·
As I delve into API exploration, I've decided to embark on developing a gallery application using the Pixels API. This endeavor presents a prime opportunity to not only understand API workings but also to bolster my development skills. By leveraging Pixels API's capabilities, I aim to craft a user-friendly interface that prioritizes seamless image browsing and quick downloads, fostering an immersive user experience. Through this project, I anticipate honing my understanding of API integration and HTTP methods while realizing the practical applications of my studies.

I only used these:

  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Javascript
